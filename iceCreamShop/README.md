## Ice Cream Shop Simulator - README

This is a basic program simulating the operations of a fictional ice cream shop. It allows you to:

* Define your ice cream flavors with details like type and price.
* Simulate customer purchases with specific scoops.
* Analyze your business by calculating profits and tracking flavor popularity.

**Getting Started**

1.  Create a file named `app.js`.
**Features**

* **Flavor Definition:**
    * The program defines various ice cream flavors as objects within an array.
    * Each flavor object includes its name, type (e.g., Chocolate, Fruit), and price.
    * This structure allows for future functionalities like filtering flavors by type or price.

* **Customer Simulation:**
    * The program simulates customer purchases by creating an array of transactions.
    * Each transaction object includes details like the scoops purchased and the total price.
    * You can add more transactions to simulate various customer scenarios.

* **Business Analysis:**
    * The program calculates your total earnings by summing up the transaction totals.
    * It also keeps track of how many scoops of each flavor have been sold.
    * This helps you identify popular flavors and adjust your inventory accordingly.

**Future Enhancements**

This is a basic model. You can extend it further by adding functionalities like:

*  A user interface for easier interaction.
*  Adding new features like toppings or sizes.
*  Generating detailed reports on sales and profits.

**Learning Objectives**

This program provides a basic introduction to:

*  JavaScript data structures like arrays and objects.
*  Simulating real-world scenarios with code.
*  Analyzing data to make informed business decisions.

**Disclaimer**

This program is for educational purposes only and does not represent a fully functional business application.
